# -SPOTIFY-DATA-ANALYSIS
In this project, I conducted an in-depth data analysis of Spotify streaming data using PostgreSQL. The goal was to uncover insights related to user preferences, most streamed tracks and artists, platform performance, and engagement trends. I worked with structured datasets to write complex SQL queries for data cleaning, aggregation summaries. 

ðŸŽµ Spotify Music Data Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing music streaming trends using PostgreSQL, aiming to compare the performance of tracks on Spotify and YouTube, identify top artists and songs, and uncover valuable insights into audience behavior and platform performance.
The analysis involves using advanced SQL queries for data cleaning, transformation, and exploration, leading to actionable findings that support data-driven decision-making for music platforms.

ðŸŽ¯ Key Objectives

Analyze and compare music streaming performance across platforms (Spotify vs YouTube).
Identify top-performing artists, albums, and tracks.
Extract business insights to support artist strategies and platform growth.
Practice advanced SQL techniques such as joins, subqueries, aggregations, and window functions.

ðŸ§° Tools & Technologies

PostgreSQL â€“ For performing complex queries and data analysis.
Excel â€“ Used for initial data cleaning and dataset understanding.
Dataset â€“ Spotify and YouTube music track data (20,000+ records).

ðŸ’¡ Key Insights

Spotify leads in overall streaming counts.
Only 385 songs have crossed 1B+ streams among 20,592 tracks.
Despacito is the most streamed track with 101M+ likes and 1.6B+ views.
6,364 tracks have higher liveness scores than the average (0.19), showing strong engagement.
SQL analysis revealed platform-specific preferences and artist performance differences.

ðŸš€ Outcome

The project provided deep insights into music streaming trends and strengthened my skills in data manipulation, SQL optimization, and query-based analysis.
These findings can help streaming platforms and artists make data-driven decisions about content strategy, marketing, and user engagement.
